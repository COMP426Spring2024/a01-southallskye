                <h2>Helen of Troy</h2>
                <p>Helen of Troy, often known as "the face that launched a thousand ships," is a central figure in Greek mythology whose beauty sparked the Trojan War. She was considered the most beautiful woman in the world. Helen was the daughter of Zeus and Leda, and her story is primarily told through Homer's "Iliad" and "Odyssey." According to myth, Helen was married to Menelaus, the king of Sparta, making her the queen of Sparta. However, her abduction (or elopement, as some versions suggest) by Paris, the prince of Troy, led to the Trojan War. This act was a result of the judgement of Paris, a contest between the goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, in which Aphrodite promised Paris the most beautiful woman in the world after he proclaimed her as the fairest. The fulfillment of this promise was Helen. The Greek expedition to retrieve Helen from Troy is one of the most famous events in Greek mythology, involving many of the renowned heroes of the age, including Achilles, Odysseus, and Agamemnon. The war lasted ten years, ending with the Greeks' cunning use of the Trojan Horse to enter and destroy the city of Troy. Helen's story does not end with the war. She is said to have returned to Sparta with Menelaus, where she lived the rest of her life. In some versions of the story, Helen's divine origins allowed her to escape mortality and join the gods. Throughout history, Helen of Troy has been depicted in various ways, from a symbol of divine beauty and desire to a figure of betrayal and the cause of widespread destruction. Her legacy is one of complexity, illustrating how beauty and love can lead to both creation and devastation.</p>
